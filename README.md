# Web Development Learning Project

This project is a collection of web development examples and exercises demonstrating various JavaScript concepts and HTML/CSS implementations.

## Features

- Interactive button demonstrations
- JavaScript fundamentals examples
- DOM manipulation exercises
- Various JavaScript loops and conditions
- Object-oriented programming examples
- Array and object manipulations
- Date and time handling
- String operations
- Mathematical calculations

## Project Structure

- `index.html` - Main HTML file containing various examples and demonstrations
- `script.js` - JavaScript file with interactive functions and examples
- `style.css` - CSS styling for the web page
- `message.js` - Additional JavaScript functionality

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser
3. Interact with the various buttons and examples to see JavaScript in action

## How to Run

### Method 1: Direct Browser Opening
1. Navigate to the project directory
2. Double-click on `index.html` to open it in your default web browser
3. All JavaScript functionality will work automatically

### Method 2: Using a Local Server (Recommended)
1. Install a local server (if you don't have one):
   - Install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
   - Install a simple HTTP server: `npm install -g http-server`

2. Start the server:
   ```bash
   # Navigate to the project directory
   cd path/to/web_learn
   
   # Start the server
   http-server
   ```

3. Open your browser and visit:
   - `http://localhost:8080` or
   - `http://127.0.0.1:8080`

### Method 3: Using VS Code Live Server
1. Install Visual Studio Code
2. Install the "Live Server" extension
3. Open the project folder in VS Code
4. Right-click on `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server"

## Examples Included

- Basic button interactions
